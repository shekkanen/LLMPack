# Large Language Model (LLM) Data Compression

## Introduction
This project explores an innovative approach to data compression using Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs, this method aims to transform substantial volumes of data into concise prompts and seeds, facilitating high levels of data compression and efficient data transfer. This open source initiative seeks to develop, refine, and standardize the use of LLMs for data encoding and decoding, pushing the boundaries of traditional data compression methods.

## Concept
The core concept involves using LLMs to encode raw data into a structured prompt that can be decoded back into its original form or a close approximation. This approach hinges on the sophisticated natural language processing abilities of models like GPT-3 or BERT, which can generate and interpret detailed text based on minimal input.

### Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**: Convert raw data into a format suitable for prompt-based encoding.
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Design prompts that efficiently encapsulate the data.
3. **Seed Utilization**: Use seeds to enhance the determinism of the data regeneration process.
4. **Encoding**: Transform data into optimized prompts.
5. **Transmission**: Send encoded data via standard communication channels.
6. **Decoding**: Decode the prompts back into the original data at the receiver’s end using a pre-trained LLM.

# Examples

## Example 1: Exploring Summarization and Text Generation
This example demonstrates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for data compression followed by data expansion. It utilizes the summarization pipeline to compress text into a summarized form and then encodes this summary into a hexadecimal format. The decompression process involves decoding this format back into text and using a text-generation model to expand this summary into a more detailed form. This showcases a novel use of LLMs, leveraging both summarization and generative capabilities of models like GPT-2.

## Example 2: Keyword Extraction and Data Regeneration
Example 2 demonstrates a practical approach to text data compression using a simple keyword extraction method. The extracted keywords are used to create a compressed prompt, which is then expanded back into a detailed text using GPT-2. This example provides a Python script that illustrates how encoding with simple keyword extraction and decoding with a pre-trained LLM can be implemented to regenerate the original text content, highlighting the utility of LLMs in processing and regenerating information.

## Example 3: Advanced Summarization with BART
Building on the concepts introduced in earlier examples, Example 3 showcases an advanced usage of Python and the transformers library to implement data compression and expansion using BART, a transformer-based model known for its effectiveness in text summarization. It details how to compress data into a summary and then attempts to expand this summary back into a detailed text using sequence generation, thereby illustrating a complete cycle of data transformation using summarization and expansion techniques.

## Example 4: Embedding Compression and Expansion Using DistilBERT and GPT-2
Example 4 provides a method for compressing text into embeddings using DistilBERT and then expanding these embeddings into detailed text using GPT-2. This example highlights a hybrid approach, where compression is achieved through neural network embeddings and expansion is handled by generative text modeling. It illustrates a sophisticated use of AI techniques to handle data compression and expansion, showcasing the potential for integrating multiple models to achieve complex tasks like data regeneration from compressed representations.
