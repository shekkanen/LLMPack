To utilize existing Large Language Models (LLMs) for a novel approach to data compression, we can think about leveraging the models' ability to generate and interpret detailed text based on minimal input. Let's conceptualize a system where we use the LLM not only to encode and decode data but to generate and use context-rich tokens that significantly condense the original data into a more manageable form. This system would involve both a method for initial data transformation and a model-trained interpretation of these transformations.

Hereâ€™s a proposed approach using a pre-trained LLM (like GPT-3 or BERT) for data compression and decompression, focusing on text data as an example:

### Concept: Context-Rich Compression Using LLM
The idea is to create a system where data is transformed into a structured prompt that leverages the context-aware capabilities of LLMs. For this, we might use a "summary-to-detail expansion" technique:

1. **Summarize**: Summarize the data into a concise form.
2. **Tokenize**: Convert the summary into a series of tokens that are designed to evoke a very specific and rich response when processed by the LLM.
3. **Expand**: Use the LLM to expand these tokens back into the original data or a close approximation.

### Python Implementation
We'll use `transformers` from Hugging Face for interaction with the LLM and some custom functions for the summarize and expand processes. This example will be illustrative and might require further refinement for practical use.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize summarization and text generation pipelines
summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt-2")

def compress_data(data):
    """
    Compress data by summarizing it and then encoding the summary into a compressed form.
    Args:
        data (str): The original text data to compress.
    
    Returns:
        str: A compressed form of the original text.
    """
    summary = summarizer(data, max_length=50, min_length=25, do_sample=False)[0]['summary_text']
    compressed_data = ''.join([f"{ord(char):x}" for char in summary])  # Simple hexadecimal encoding of summary
    return compressed_data

def decompress_data(compressed_data):
    """
    Decompress data by decoding the compressed form back into text and expanding it.
    Args:
        compressed_data (str): The compressed text data.
    
    Returns:
        str: The decompressed text, an approximation of the original data.
    """
    decoded_summary = ''.join([chr(int(compressed_data[i:i+2], 16)) for i in range(0, len(compressed_data), 2)])
    expanded_data = generator(f"Expand this summary into a detailed text: {decoded_summary}", max_length=200)[0]['generated_text']
    return expanded_data

# Example usage
original_data = "This is a long text that needs to be compressed using an innovative method utilizing LLMs. The process involves summarizing the text, encoding it, and then expanding it back to its original form or something close to it."
compressed_data = compress_data(original_data)
decompressed_data = decompress_data(compressed_data)

print("Original Data:", original_data)
print("Compressed Data:", compressed_data)
print("Decompressed Data:", decompressed_data)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Summarization**: We first summarize the text to reduce its length significantly. This step captures the essence of the text in fewer words.
2. **Compression**: The summary is then encoded into a hexadecimal string. This step simulates a lightweight compression mechanism. For more robust applications, you could consider advanced encoding schemes or even use specific key tokens that the LLM can expand.
3. **Decompression**: The compressed string is decoded back to the summary, which is then expanded using the text generation model. This step relies on the LLM's ability to use the context provided in the prompt to regenerate detailed content.

This framework serves as a conceptual starting point. Practical applications would need rigorous testing and optimization, particularly in tuning the summarization and text generation steps to ensure fidelity and efficiency. Additionally, handling non-text data would require adapting the methodology to different forms of data representation and possibly training specific models suited for those data types.
