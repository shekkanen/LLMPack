Calculate Compression Differences

Client A wants to upload their new car model image to client B.

Old way: Compress the image or use a compressed image format.

My way, based on my LLM data compression idea, is just to send prompt parameters so that client B can create the identical car image.

In the scenario you described, you're interested in comparing traditional image compression methods with a novel approach that uses text-based prompts to recreate images through a generative model.

To demonstrate the potential compression benefits of the LLM-based prompt method compared to traditional image compression, we need to make some assumptions about file sizes and compression ratios.

Let's assume we have a high-quality car image with the following characteristics: original_image_size_mb = 5 MB for the original image size.

Traditional image compression ratios can vary widely, but let's assume a high-quality compression, which results in the compressed image being 20% of the original size.

For the LLM-based prompt method, we'll estimate the size based on a reasonable length for a detailed prompt, which is about 500 characters. Assuming 1 byte per character, the size of the prompt in kilobytes (KB) would be prompt_size_kb.

Let's compare the sizes: compressed_image_size_kb for the compressed image and prompt_size_kb for the prompt size.

This method requires both sender and receiver to have access to the same LLM capable of generating the image from the prompt.

To analyze the compression differences in a tangible way, you'd need to look at specific metrics such as the size of the traditional compressed image file versus the size of the text prompt, the fidelity of the regenerated image to the original, and the computational resources and time required to generate the image from the prompt at the receiver's end.

The novel approach hinges on the efficiency and capability of the LLM to regenerate the image with high fidelity based solely on the prompt. It's a promising concept, especially for scenarios where maintaining exact visual fidelity isn't critical, but further exploration and testing would be necessary to evaluate its practicality.

Can this be done with not just with images but sound, video, etc.?

Yes, the concept of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for data compression could theoretically be extended to sound, video, and other data types. The idea would be to convert various forms of media into a set of prompts that an LLM can use to regenerate the original content. Here's how it could work for each media type:

For sound, the data could be transformed into a prompt describing the audio content, and specialized LLMs trained to interpret these prompts could recreate the audio file.

For video, the content could be described through a series of prompts that encapsulate scenes, actions, colors, and transitions, with an LLM capable of video generation recreating the video content.

Essentially, any data that can be described textually in a concise and accurate way could be transmitted as prompts for an LLM to recreate, including 3D models, code, and scientific data.

However, this idea presents several challenges, such as the fidelity of the regenerated content to the original, the training required for the LLMs, and the computational resources needed.

While the concept is technically conceivable, realizing it would be a significant technological feat. The efficiency gains in data transmission would need to be weighed against these challenges and the cost of computation required to generate the media. It's an exciting area for future research and development in AI and data compression.
