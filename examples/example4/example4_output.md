### Initial Warnings and Settings
- Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing DistilBertModel: ['vocab_layer_norm.bias',  'vocab_transform.bias', 'vocab_projector.weight', 'vocab_transform.weight', 'vocab_projector.bias', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DistilBertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DistilBertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
- The attention mask and the pad token id were not set. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
- Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.
